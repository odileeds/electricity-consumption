# Electricity consumption in England, Scotland, & Wales

This repository creates GeoJSON files for domestic and non-domestic electricity consumption by MSOA/IMZ across England, Scotland and Wales using [data published by Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/lower-and-middle-super-output-areas-electricity-consumption) (22 December 2020). For each feature we give the yearly total (TWh) and median (kWh per meter). Only energy consumption that has been assigned to MSOA/IMZs is included here.
