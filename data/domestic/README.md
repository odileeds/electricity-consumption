# Domestic data

The data in this directory are [published by Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/lower-and-middle-super-output-areas-electricity-consumption) (22 December 2020) under the [OGLv3 licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

The files contain total domestic electricity consumption, number of meters, mean and median consumption for MSOA regions across England, Scotland and Wales.

Notes:
  * Meters that have not successfully been assigned to a geography due to insufficient address information are counted in the 'Unallocated' category at the bottom of the table.
  * Meters or MSOA's that are deemed to be disclosive at MSOA level are re-allocated to the 'Unallocated' category at the bottom of the table
